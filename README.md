# Stochasic Processes and Simulation
This is some of the code I wrote for the course Stochastic Processes and Simulation at the Ume√• University.
This course is part of the Master's program in engineering physics.
I took this course in the autumn of 2022.
The course was taught by [Konrad Abramowicz](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/konrad-abramowicz/).

This course is focused on the simulation of stochastic processes and the analysis of the results.
The course is divided into two parts, one theoretical and one practical.
## Theoretical section
The theoretical section is focused on the theory behind the simulation of stochastic processes such as:
- Markov chains
- Poisson processes, homogeneous and inhomogeneous
- Brownian motion
- Random walks

The course also covers the theory behind the analysis of the results of the simulations such as:
- The central limit theorem
- The law of large numbers
- Markov chain convergence
- The Poisson process convergence
- The convergence of the random walk
- The convergence of the Brownian motion
- Random Game Theory
## Practical section
The practical section is focused on the simulation of the stochastic processes mentioned above, mainly using matlab and Simulink.
This section mainly consisted of computer labs where we were given a task and had to solve it using the tools we learned in the theoretical section.
The main task was to for me to simulate a gas station where no further information was given.
I decided to simulate a gas station where the customers arrive according to a non homogenouse Poisson process. This processes was simulated using traffic data from the US.
This data was then used to simulate the arrival of customers to the gas station. The customers then had to wait in line to get their gas choosing weather to stay in line or leave the gas station.
All properties of the cars were simulated using random variables suitable for the properties.
